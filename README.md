## Consulting Project
#### This project was a collaborative effort with a professor from the University of Minnesota Duluth, focusing on trauma-sensitive yoga instructors and their coping strategies to combat compassion fatigue. Compassion fatigue often encompasses secondary trauma and job burnout. Our study aimed to thoroughly understand how various coping mechanisms relate to the severity of compassion fatigue. We set out to achieve three primary objectives:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the data landscape.
- Evaluate and rank 15 coping strategies based on their effectiveness against levels of compassion fatigue.
- Group the coping strategies into meaningful categories for better understanding and application.
